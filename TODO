Write diff hypervisor from scratch.
Start from very basic:
  1. emulating the execuatable (elf) itself.
  2. Try implementing the userlevel threads (green threads) without any library support.
  3. Play with struct ucontext; posix api also
  4. Read the qemu history (v0.1.0) is very basic
  5. We should be able to read the instructions (text) and maintain the memory (data & bss), stack, and register context state, and emulator will just change these state based on the intruction.
